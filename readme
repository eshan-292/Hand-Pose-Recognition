File Structure:
1. main.py : contains the main code for training the model and generating inferences
2. app.py : contains code for the real world application
3. hog.py : contains the code for extracting the hog features 
4. vid_maker.py : contains the code used to generate the test_video for the real world application

Running Instructions:
1. For main.py: Run the following command:-
python3 main.py <path_to_input_dir> <path_to_output_dir>

-> path_to_input_dir: path to the directory containing the input images to be tested
-> path_to_output_dir: path to the directory where the labelled output images are to be stored 

Example Running Command:
python3 main.py test/ output/


2. For app.py: Run the following command:-
python3 app.py <path_to_audio_file> <path_to_video_file>

-> path_to_audio_file: path to the audio file to be played
-> path_to_video_file: path to the video on which inference has to be generated

Example Running Command:
python3 app.py summer-night-piano-solo-6885.mp3 test_video.mp4

3. For app2.py: Run the following command:-
python3 app2.py <path_to_video_file>
-> path_to_video_file: path to the video on which inference has to be generated

Example Running Command:
python3 app2.py test_video.mp4
